      <p className='contact-text'>
      Greetings, fellow travelers of the galaxy! I am Victoria, a Jedi Master of full-stack development hailing from the distant lands of Argentina.
      <br/>
       With over a year of experience wielding the MEAN & MERN stack, I've honed my skills in lightsaber-like precision to build extraordinary web applications.
       <br/>
        In my most recent journeys, I contributed to the creation of new features and vanquished the bugs that lurked in the shadows, ensuring the continuous improvement of the applications.
        My path to becoming a masterful developer was guided by the teachings of the illustrious Henry's bootcamp, where I delved into the mysteries of HTML, JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS, Styled Components, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and more. Throughout my immersive training, I clocked more than 900 hours of coding since I embarked on this voyage in September 2021.
        <br/>
        Collaboration is the Force that binds us all. Through my travels, I've honed my teamwork skills, valuing the camaraderie of like-minded individuals. A true leader fosters an environment where every team member can thrive and contribute their best.
        <br/>
        Just like a true Jedi, I am a seeker of knowledge, always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set. My unwavering dedication to continuous learning keeps me attuned to the latest industry trends, much like Jedi mastering their connection to the Force.
        <br/>
        If you wish to join forces or discuss potential opportunities, send me a message through the galactic communication channels below! And may the Force be with you, always!
